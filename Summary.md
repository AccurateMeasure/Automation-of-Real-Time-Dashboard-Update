# Summary

Automating dashboard update in real time using python through APIs requests or calls can be very useful especially in handling detailed error, detecting failure trigger and sending customized notifications to streamline troubleshooting process.
Considering the emerging multi-cloud services adoption, the need to get data from different APIs and tender dashboads in real-time for service operations and even reduce the cost of cloud service resources used. This project have implemented practical steps 
to automate power BI dashboards update using python script, configure secure power BI API permissions in Azure portal and Power BI services as a power BI global admin and allowed access to service principals, respecting the 
security rule of assigning least priviledges required for thier specified task, set up the python script environment, and highlighted alternative server or free task scheduler like Windows task scheduler, cron jobs and jupyter scheduler different from cloud services(like Azure, Google, AWS and Snowflake) or 
power automate, to run scheduled task and successfully automated Power BI dataset/dashboard refreshes with secure implemented email notifications.

This project and python script can be further improved and enhanced to collect data from some APIs, perform data processing with pandas and ingest the processed data into Power BI dataset in real-time.
